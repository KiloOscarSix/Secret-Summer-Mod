P "Ah, sorry. I was just checking out the jet. No matter how many times I fly in something as luxurious as this, I can't help but kinda gawk at it all."

I "*laugh* I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. You know I didn't exactly grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth. Quite the opposite, so anything shiny and new impresses me."

with dissolve

I "I do get that part too, but you have put in plenty of work growing up with John, and you're about to secure the company's biggest contract to date."

P "It wasn't easy tracking this thing down though, since apparently, they discontinued the toys a while ago. That's why it took so long to give you a present in the first place."

scene j23
